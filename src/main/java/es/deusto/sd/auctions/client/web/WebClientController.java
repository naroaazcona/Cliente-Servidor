/**
 * WebClientController class serves as the primary controller for the web client
 * application built with Spring Boot. It orchestrates the interactions between
 * the web application and the AuctionsService through the
 * RestTemplateServiceProxy, managing HTTP requests and responses while serving
 * Thymeleaf templates.
 * 
 * The use of the `@Controller` annotation in the WebClientController class
 * signifies that this class serves as a front controller in the Spring MVC
 * architecture. This annotation allows Spring to recognize and manage the class
 * as a web component, enabling it to handle HTTP requests and produce responses
 * based on user interactions.
 * 
 * Spring Boot's `@Controller` facilitates the use of model attributes through
 * the `Model` interface. The `model.addAttribute()` method is used to add
 * attributes to the model, making them accessible in the Thymeleaf templates.
 * This method takes a key-value pair, where the key is the name of the
 * attribute that can be referenced in the template, and the value is the actual
 * data to be passed. For instance, when `model.addAttribute("currentUrl",
 * currentUrl)` is called, the current URL is stored in the model with the key
 * "currentUrl", allowing it to be easily accessed in the corresponding
 * Thymeleaf view. This mechanism enables the dynamic rendering of content based
 * on the application state, ensuring that user interfaces are responsive and
 * adaptable to user interactions.
 * 
 * The methods of the controller return a `String`, which represents the name of
 * the Thymeleaf template to be rendered. This design pattern allows the
 * controller to define the appropriate view for each action. For instance, when
 * the `home` method is called, it returns the string "index", which tells
 * Spring to render the `index.html` Thymeleaf template. The mapping methods not
 * only process data but also dictate the presentation layer, facilitating a
 * clear separation between business logic and user interface concerns.
 * 
 * This class uses two distinct mappings to handle the login process, allowing
 * for a clear separation of responsibilities and improving code organization.
 * 
 * The `@GetMapping("/login")` method is responsible for displaying the login
 * page. This method prepares and returns the view containing the login form,
 * ensuring that users can easily access the interface needed to enter their
 * credentials.
 * 
 * On the other hand, the `@PostMapping("/login")` method handles the submission
 * of the form, processing user input, validating credentials, and managing the
 * authentication logic. This separation allows each method to have a single
 * responsibility, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
